      <h1>Review</h1>
      <p>Souls in the Great Machine was very enjoyable and was well worth the read for me. I can see why it isn't considered one of the all time classics but is well respected in its nieche.</p>
      <p>The world building is good, with all the different creations they come up with to get around limitations on electricity and steam and why the limitation are there in the first place. It's not to complex either. I also like how it restricts it's self to just the South end of Australia and the mysteries what lies beyond.</p>
      <p>The characters are pretty good too. Not too many of them and each with memorable personalities and quirks.</p>
      <p>I found the mystery of the plot and where its going to be intreuging and made me want to find out whats going to happen next.</p>
      <p>I didn't really like how Lemorel became the Leader of the Neverlanders. In fact, I didn't much like the Neverlanders sections in general. I also thought the characters came off as to over powered and Mary Sues. Like Lemorel is an expert dueler, and manages to take over and control all of the Allspring armies even though shes not even from that culture. Zarvora is the worst for this, shes super inteligent, can build computers and lots of other new tech, has discovered how all these diferent AIs and mirror sun work, is an expert dueler and strategist, and becomes Overmayor from nothing. Having said that I do like her character, how shes not an out and out good guy and is somewhat socially awkward, doing awful things in what she considers the greater good.</p>
      <p>Another thing I didn't like was how components of the Calculor loved it and were devoted to Zarvora despite what she'd done to them. Especially Denkar who becomes her husband.</p>
      <p>Thats just being a bit nit picky however. Most of the plot is solid and interesting. I liked the world, the building of technologies, and the greater mysteries it introduces. I also think the idea of human components in a computer is cool. It also had some emotional moments it there.</p>
      <p>It's a trillogy so I'm interested in seeing what happens with the next 2 books!</p>
